# Weather Now ☀️
Weather Now is an application built with React, providing users with real-time weather information by fetching data from OpenWeatherMap API. To enhance the user experience, the app dynamically displays the current temperature and weather condition, along with icons and background colors that change based on the weather condition. Whether it's sunny, cloudy, rainy, or snowy, users can easily understand the weather at a glance.
